# CSGO RankMe stats

This application shows statistics from [Kento RankMe plugin](https://github.com/rogeraabbccdd/Kento-Rankme)

This includes:
 - A Discord bot.
 - A webserver

## Installation

You will need a MySQL database that is storing the statistics, this bot does not support SQLite (yet). Atleast NodeJs v8.x is recommended.
